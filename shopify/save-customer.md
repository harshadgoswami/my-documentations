To create a customer address in Shopify using Node.js and TypeScript, you can utilize the Shopify API and the `shopify-api-node` library. Here's an example of how you can implement it:

First, make sure you have the `shopify-api-node` library installed. You can install it using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install shopify-api-node
```

Next, create a TypeScript file (e.g., `createCustomerAddress.ts`) and include the following code:

```typescript
import Shopify, { Auth } from "shopify-api-node";

// Replace 'YOUR_SHOPIFY_STORE_URL' with your actual Shopify store URL
const shopifyStoreUrl = "https://YOUR_SHOPIFY_STORE_URL.myshopify.com";

const shopify = new Shopify({
  shopName: "YOUR_SHOPIFY_STORE_URL",
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  password: "YOUR_API_PASSWORD",
});

async function createCustomerAddress(customerId: number, address: any) {
  try {
    const createdAddress = await shopify.customerAddress.create(
      customerId,
      address
    );

    console.log("Created Address:", createdAddress);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error creating customer address:", error);
  }
}

// Example usage: Create a customer address
const customerId = 123456789; // Replace with the actual customer ID
const address = {
  address1: "123 Main St",
  city: "New York",
  province: "New York",
  zip: "10001",
  country: "United States",
};

createCustomerAddress(customerId, address);
```

Make sure to replace `'YOUR_SHOPIFY_STORE_URL'`, `'YOUR_API_KEY'`, and `'YOUR_API_PASSWORD'` with your actual Shopify store URL, API key, and API password, respectively.

The code uses the `shopify-api-node` library to create a new instance of the Shopify API with your store's credentials. Then, the `create` method of the `customerAddress` resource is called with the customer ID and the address details as parameters. The created address object is then logged to the console.

Replace `customerId` with the actual customer ID to which you want to add the address. Also, customize the `address` object with the appropriate address details you want to create for the customer.

Remember to handle any errors that may occur during the API call by catching and logging them appropriately.

This example demonstrates how to create a customer address using Node.js and TypeScript in Shopify.
