To retrieve a customer from their email using the `shopify-api-node` library in Node.js, you can make use of the `customer.search()` method. Here's an example of how you can implement it:

First, make sure you have the `shopify-api-node` library installed. You can install it using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install shopify-api-node
```

Next, create a TypeScript file (e.g., `getCustomerByEmail.ts`) and include the following code:

```typescript
import Shopify, { Auth } from "shopify-api-node";

// Replace 'YOUR_SHOPIFY_STORE_URL' with your actual Shopify store URL
const shopifyStoreUrl = "https://YOUR_SHOPIFY_STORE_URL.myshopify.com";

const shopify = new Shopify({
  shopName: "YOUR_SHOPIFY_STORE_URL",
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  password: "YOUR_API_PASSWORD",
});

async function getCustomerByEmail(email: string) {
  try {
    const customers = await shopify.customer.search({ email });

    if (customers.length > 0) {
      const customer = customers[0]; // Assuming the first customer is the desired one
      console.log("Customer:", customer);
    } else {
      console.log("Customer not found");
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error retrieving customer:", error);
  }
}

// Example usage: Retrieve a customer by email
const customerEmail = "customer@example.com"; // Replace with the desired customer's email
getCustomerByEmail(customerEmail);
```

Make sure to replace `'YOUR_SHOPIFY_STORE_URL'`, `'YOUR_API_KEY'`, and `'YOUR_API_PASSWORD'` with your actual Shopify store URL, API key, and API password, respectively.

The code uses the `shopify-api-node` library to create a new instance of the Shopify API with your store's credentials. Then, the `search()` method of the `customer` resource is called with the email as a search parameter. If a customer with the provided email is found, the first customer object is logged to the console. Otherwise, a message is logged indicating that the customer was not found.

Replace `customerEmail` with the actual email of the customer you want to retrieve.

Remember to handle any errors that may occur during the API call by catching and logging them appropriately.

This example demonstrates how to retrieve a customer from their email using the `shopify-api-node` library in Node.js.
