Creating multiple accounts using the same seed phrase involves deriving additional Ethereum addresses from the same initial seed phrase. You can achieve this by using Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallets, which follow the BIP-32, BIP-39, and BIP-44 standards. ethers.js provides functionality to create HD wallets and derive multiple accounts from a single seed phrase.

Here's an example in TypeScript:

```typescript
import { ethers } from "ethers";

function createMultipleAccounts(seedPhrase: string, numAccounts: number) {
  // Create an HD wallet from the seed phrase
  const hdNode = ethers.utils.HDNode.fromMnemonic(seedPhrase);

  // Derive multiple accounts from the HD wallet
  for (let i = 0; i < numAccounts; i++) {
    const derivedWallet = hdNode.derivePath(`m/44'/60'/0'/0/${i}`);
    const address = derivedWallet.address;
    const privateKey = derivedWallet.privateKey;

    console.log(`Account ${i + 1}:`);
    console.log("Address:", address);
    console.log("Private Key:", privateKey);
    console.log("---------------------------");
  }
}

// Replace 'your seed phrase' with the actual seed phrase
const seedPhrase = "your seed phrase";

// Specify the number of accounts you want to create
const numberOfAccounts = 5;

// Call the function to create multiple accounts
createMultipleAccounts(seedPhrase, numberOfAccounts);
```

This code snippet:

1. Takes a seed phrase as input.
2. Creates an HD wallet using `ethers.utils.HDNode.fromMnemonic(seedPhrase)`.
3. Derives multiple accounts using the `derivePath` method with a specific path. The path format follows the BIP-44 standard for Ethereum accounts.
4. Prints the address and private key for each derived account.

Replace `'your seed phrase'` with your actual seed phrase, and adjust `numberOfAccounts` as needed. Please note that the private keys are sensitive information and should be handled securely. Ensure that you keep the seed phrase and private keys confidential and never share them.

Remember to follow best practices for securely managing cryptographic keys and seed phrases.
