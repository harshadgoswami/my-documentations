To create a Solana network address and its corresponding private key, you can generate a keypair using the `@solana/web3.js` library in Node.js. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Install Required Packages:**
   Make sure you have the `@solana/web3.js` package installed. You can install it via npm:

   ```
   npm install @solana/web3.js
   ```

2. **Write Node.js Script:**
   Create a Node.js script (e.g., `generateSolanaAddress.js`) and write the following code:

   ```javascript
   const { Keypair, Connection } = require("@solana/web3.js");

   async function generateSolanaAddress() {
     try {
       // Generate a new keypair
       const keypair = Keypair.generate();

       console.log("Public Key:", keypair.publicKey.toBase58());
       console.log("Private Key:", keypair.secretKey.toString("hex"));
     } catch (error) {
       console.error("Error:", error);
     }
   }

   generateSolanaAddress();
   ```

3. **Run the Script:**
   Run the Node.js script using Node.js:
   ```
   node generateSolanaAddress.js
   ```

This script will generate a new Solana keypair, which includes a public key and a private key. The public key is the Solana address, and the private key is the secret key used for signing transactions.

Make sure to securely store the private key as it grants access to the associated Solana address and funds. Never share your private key with anyone and consider using a secure key management solution.
