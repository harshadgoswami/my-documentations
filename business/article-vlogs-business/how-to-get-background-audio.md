To get audio for the background of a YouTube video, you must ensure that you use audio that is either royalty-free, licensed, or created by you. Here are a few ways to find or create audio for your YouTube video's background:

### 1. **YouTube Audio Library**

- YouTube itself provides a vast **YouTube Audio Library** that contains royalty-free music and sound effects.
- **Steps**:
  1.  Go to **YouTube Studio** (studio.youtube.com).
  2.  On the left-hand sidebar, click **Audio Library**.
  3.  Browse or search for music by genre, mood, duration, or attribution requirement.
  4.  Download the track to use in your videos.

**Pros**: Free and safe to use for YouTube videos.

### 2. **Royalty-Free Music Websites**

There are various websites where you can download free or paid royalty-free music for use in your videos. Some popular ones include:

- **Epidemic Sound** (paid subscription with high-quality tracks).
- **Artlist.io** (paid subscription with unlimited downloads and licensing).
- **Free Music Archive** (FMA) (free tracks under Creative Commons licenses).
- **Incompetech** (by Kevin MacLeod) (free with attribution).
- **Bensound** (free and paid options, requires attribution for free use).

**Note**: Always check the licensing requirements—some may require you to give credit to the artist in your video description.

### 3. **Create Your Own Music**

- If you're musically inclined, you can create your own music using audio production software like **GarageBand** (Mac), **FL Studio**, or **Audacity** (free).
- This gives you complete ownership and control over the music, allowing you to avoid copyright issues.

### 4. **Purchase Music Licenses**

- If you want to use specific tracks, you can purchase a license from websites like **AudioJungle**, **PremiumBeat**, or **Pond5**.
- Once you purchase a license, you can use the music for your videos without worrying about copyright claims.

### 5. **Use Music from Creative Commons (CC)**

- Some artists release their music under Creative Commons licenses, allowing you to use their music freely as long as you follow the attribution guidelines.
- You can find Creative Commons music on platforms like **Jamendo**, **SoundCloud**, or **ccMixter**.

**Important**: Make sure to read the specific license for each track, as some may restrict commercial use or require you to provide attribution.

### 6. **Collaborate with Musicians**

- You can collaborate with independent musicians or composers to create custom music for your videos. You can find musicians on platforms like **Fiverr**, **Upwork**, or social media who are open to creating music under specific agreements.

### 7. **Avoid Copyrighted Music**

- Be cautious of using music that is copyrighted or belongs to major artists without proper permission, as this can result in **Content ID claims**, demonetization, or even takedowns of your video on YouTube.

### Final Tips:

- **Always check licenses**: Ensure the music you're using is allowed for use in YouTube videos.
- **Give proper attribution**: If the music requires attribution, include the artist's name and track title in your video description.
- **Check YouTube’s Copyright Guidelines**: Avoid any violations to keep your channel safe from strikes and takedowns.
