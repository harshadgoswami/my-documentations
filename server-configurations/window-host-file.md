The Windows hosts file is a plain text file located in the system directory that allows you to manually map hostnames to IP addresses. By modifying the hosts file, you can control how your computer resolves domain names before reaching out to DNS servers.

Here's how you can access and modify the hosts file in Windows:

1. Open File Explorer and navigate to the following directory:

   ```
   C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\
   ```

2. In the "etc" folder, you'll find a file named "hosts." Right-click on the file and choose "Open with" and then select a text editor like Notepad.

3. If prompted for administrative permissions, confirm and proceed.

4. Once the hosts file is open, you'll see its contents. By default, it may contain some commented lines providing examples and explanations.

   To add an entry, you can specify the IP address followed by one or more hostnames. The format is:

   ```
   [IP address]   [hostname]
   ```

   For example, to map the hostname "example.com" to the IP address "192.168.1.100," add the following line at the end of the file:

   ```
   192.168.1.100   example.com
   ```

   You can add multiple entries, each on a separate line.

5. After making the desired changes, save the hosts file and close the text editor.

It's worth noting that modifying the hosts file can be useful for testing or blocking specific domains. However, be cautious while editing the hosts file as incorrect modifications can lead to issues with network connectivity or domain resolution.
