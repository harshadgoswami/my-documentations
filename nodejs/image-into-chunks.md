Sure, if you want to read the image in chunks of a specific size instead of reading the whole file at once, you can achieve this by using the `fs` module's `read` method. Here's how you can do it:

```javascript
const fs = require("fs");

const chunkSize = 1024; // Specify your desired chunk size
const imagePath = "path/to/your/image.jpg"; // Replace with your image path

const readStream = fs.createReadStream(imagePath, { highWaterMark: chunkSize });

const imageChunks = [];

readStream.on("data", (chunk) => {
  imageChunks.push(chunk);
});

readStream.on("end", () => {
  const imageBuffer = Buffer.concat(imageChunks);
  console.log("Image buffer in chunks:", imageBuffer);
});

readStream.on("error", (err) => {
  console.error("Error reading image:", err);
});
```

In this example:

- `chunkSize` is the size of each chunk in bytes.
- `fs.createReadStream` creates a readable stream that reads the file in chunks of the specified size (`highWaterMark`).
- `imageChunks` is an array that collects the chunks as they're read.
- The `data` event is triggered whenever a chunk of data is read from the stream.
- The `end` event is triggered when the entire stream has been read.
- The `error` event is triggered if there's an error while reading the file.

Remember to replace `'path/to/your/image.jpg'` with the actual path to the image file you want to read in chunks.
