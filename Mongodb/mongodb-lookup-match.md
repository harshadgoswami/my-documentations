Yes, in MongoDB, you can use the `$lookup` aggregation stage to perform a left outer join between two collections and also include additional conditions to filter the joined documents. You can achieve this by using the `$match` stage after the `$lookup` stage to specify additional conditions for filtering the joined documents.

Here's an example of how you can use `$lookup` with additional conditions:

Suppose you have two collections: `orders` and `products`, and you want to find all orders along with their associated products where the product's price is greater than a certain value (e.g., $50). You can do this with the following aggregation query:

```javascript
db.orders.aggregate([
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "products",
      localField: "productId",
      foreignField: "_id",
      as: "product",
    },
  },
  {
    $unwind: "$product", // Convert the 'product' array into a single document
  },
  {
    $match: {
      "product.price": { $gt: 50 }, // Additional condition to filter by product price
    },
  },
  {
    $project: {
      _id: 1,
      orderNumber: 1,
      productName: "$product.name",
      productPrice: "$product.price",
    },
  },
]);
```

In this example:

1. We use the `$lookup` stage to join the `orders` collection with the `products` collection based on the `productId` field in the `orders` collection and the `_id` field in the `products` collection.
2. We use the `$unwind` stage to convert the resulting `product` array into a single document.
3. We use the `$match` stage to add an additional condition to filter the joined documents, selecting only those where the product's price is greater than $50.
4. Finally, we use the `$project` stage to shape the output document as desired.

This query will return a list of orders along with their associated product details but only for products with a price greater than $50. You can customize the `$match` stage to add different conditions as needed to filter the joined documents further.
