The `$documentNumber` operator in MongoDB is a window function that assigns a unique, sequential number to each document within the aggregation pipeline. The numbering starts at 1 and increments by 1 for each document. Itâ€™s commonly used for ranking, ordering, or uniquely identifying documents in a result set.

---

### Syntax

```json
$documentNumber: {}
```

The `$documentNumber` operator is used inside the `$setWindowFields` stage in the `output` section.

---

### Example: Sequential Numbering of Documents

Suppose you have a collection called `students` with the following data:

```json
[
  { "name": "Alice", "score": 85 },
  { "name": "Bob", "score": 90 },
  { "name": "Charlie", "score": 80 }
]
```

#### Task: Assign a sequential number to each document based on their order in the pipeline.

---

### Query

```javascript
db.students.aggregate([
  {
    $setWindowFields: {
      sortBy: { score: -1 }, // Sort documents by score in descending order
      output: {
        rank: {
          $documentNumber: {}, // Assign sequential numbers starting from 1
        },
      },
    },
  },
]);
```

---

### Output

```json
[
  { "name": "Bob", "score": 90, "rank": 1 },
  { "name": "Alice", "score": 85, "rank": 2 },
  { "name": "Charlie", "score": 80, "rank": 3 }
]
```

---

### Explanation

1. **Sorting**: Documents are sorted by the `score` field in descending order (`sortBy: { score: -1 }`).
2. **$documentNumber**: Assigns sequential numbers starting from `1` to each document after sorting.
3. **Output**: The new `rank` field contains the assigned numbers.

---

### Use Case: Pagination

If you want to implement custom pagination by assigning document numbers, you can use `$documentNumber` and then filter documents based on their position.

---

### Example: Paginate Top Scorers

To get only the first two documents based on their rank:

```javascript
db.students.aggregate([
  {
    $setWindowFields: {
      sortBy: { score: -1 },
      output: {
        rank: {
          $documentNumber: {},
        },
      },
    },
  },
  { $match: { rank: { $lte: 2 } } }, // Filter to get documents with rank 1 or 2
]);
```

---

### Output

```json
[
  { "name": "Bob", "score": 90, "rank": 1 },
  { "name": "Alice", "score": 85, "rank": 2 }
]
```

---

### Key Benefits of `$documentNumber`

- **Sequential Numbering**: Provides an easy way to assign sequential numbers to documents.
- **Custom Sorting**: Works seamlessly with `sortBy` to control the order of numbering.
- **Dynamic Ranking**: Helps in ranking documents based on specific criteria.
- **Efficient Pagination**: Simplifies pagination logic when combined with `$match`.

This operator is particularly useful in analytics, ranking, and result ordering scenarios.
